              Refugees Helping Refugees is a largely volunteer-run organization. Because RHR is a nonprofit and receives
              limited funding from grants for operational and programming costs, the organization is able to offer few
              paid positions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              This makes the need for proactive, empowered, and passionate volunteers essential to our survival. Our
              volunteers are reliable and innovative, and seek to make a positive difference in the refugee and
              Rochester community.
